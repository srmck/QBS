This project contains the code for a two-level quantum Bloch solver for arbitrary magnetic fields.
Using the unitary integration method, this code can be easily extended to arbitrary potentials in the semiclassical limit
Currently, the code base is designed for simple fields and simulations of the radio-frequency neutron spin flipper developed by Indiana University.

Thing to add in the future
1. Methods for integrating orbital angular momentum
2. Add ray-tracing option for 2D and 3D potentials
3. Expand code to include infinite-dimensional algebras
4. Enhance visualization code

Other algorithms/methods may also prove useful:
1.  Wei-Normann method (factorization)
2.  Higher-order Magnus method (enhancing convergence)
3.  Fer method (for seperable potentials)
4.  Wilcox method (simplier version of the Fer method)
