# QBS
Quantum Bloch Solver for arbitrary magnetic fields.

Mainly for use in the IU RF flipper paper, but most of the code can be ported into a new project that can look at at any magnetic field.

Right now the simulation is on;y in 1D, but in principle, it can be extended into a ray-tracing program.
