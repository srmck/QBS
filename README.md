# QBS
This project is the code for a two-level quantum Bloch solver for arbitrary magnetic fields.

Mainly for use in the 2023 Indiana University RF flipper paper, but most of the code can be ported into a new project that can look at at the neutron's response to any magnetic field.

This version of the QBS is only 1D.

Things to add:
1. File for analyzing orbital angular momentum
2. 2D and 3D ray-tracing options
3. Expand from Bloch solver to solving the Schrodinger equation (only 2D is probably feasible)
